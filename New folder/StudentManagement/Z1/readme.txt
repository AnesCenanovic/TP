This C++ program allows users to create and analyze geometric shapes, including:

Rectangle (Pravougaonik)
Circle (Krug)
Triangle (Trougao)
Each shape has properties such as perimeter (obim) and area (površina). The program uses polymorphism and smart pointers (std::shared_ptr) to manage objects dynamically.

Features
✅ User inputs the number of shapes and their dimensions.
✅ Validates user input to prevent incorrect values.
✅ Calculates and displays perimeter and area for each shape.
