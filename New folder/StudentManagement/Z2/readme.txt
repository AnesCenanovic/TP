This C++ program models a student record system using OOP principles such as abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. It provides a base class (ApstraktniStudent) and two derived classes:

StudentBachelor (Bachelor's student)
StudentMaster (Master's student)
Each student has attributes like name, index number, exam count, and GPA and can register new exams or reset their grades.

Features
✅ Supports both Bachelor's and Master's students.
✅ Tracks the number of passed exams and calculates GPA.
✅ Prevents invalid grades (must be between 5 and 10).
✅ Allows resetting all grades.
✅ Implements polymorphic behavior (e.g., DajKopiju() for cloning).
